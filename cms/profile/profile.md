  Picture this… It’s 1pm, you’re relaxing on the couch and hear this little
  voice belting Whitney Houston’s “And I’m saving all my for you”.  Well that
  was the vibe in the Philadelphia born singer’s household as a toddler.  Safa
  has been entertaining since she could speak. So she took her natural gift and
  passion for singing and turned it into a lifestyle.  


  While she attributes her vocal beginnings to singing Whitney Houston tunes through her mother’s house as a child her voice truly developed where many great singers get their start, church. The more she fell in love with singing the more she wanted to know.  Safa spent her high school years studying vocal music at the famed Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts.  It was at C.A.P.A that Safa developed a deep appreciation for classical music.  As Safa approached high school graduation she was accepted to West Chester University’s Vocal Music Program.  During her college years she honed her craft and fused her classical vocal techniques with her natural, soulful approach to singing. 


  Safa’s intense love and adoration for art of singing lead her to venture into vocal coaching.  She opened UBFS Studios, a vocal performance coaching studio, in the winter of 2021. “Vocal athletes need a safe space to train and study”. Safa has a unique ability to take the complexities of music and make them accessible and attainable for her students. 


  Safa recently had the pleasure to sing background vocals for the legendary Ms. Lauryn Hill, Angie Stone and Sam Smith.  Currently you can find Safa delivering entertaining, star powered performances on stages all over the Tri state area, vocal coaching and penning her first project, manifesting a work of art that will be reminiscent of 90s and early 2000s R&B and pop.
